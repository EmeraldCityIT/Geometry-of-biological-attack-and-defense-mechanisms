As a virus cell approaches a cell, it uses HA protiens as a type of hook or grapple which is used to physically attach a virus to the targeted cell.

When the lipid envalope is agitated by physical contact with the targeted cell, NA protiens fire RNA "spores" into the target cell, which cause damage to tissue and reproduce mutated viral offspring.
