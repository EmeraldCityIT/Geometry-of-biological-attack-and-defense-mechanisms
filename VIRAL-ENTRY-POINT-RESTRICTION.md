The Nose:

Using the finger or pressure on the passageways of the nose during viral fight off causes viral cells to burst due to stimulation of lipid envelopes. This method of clearing passageways during viral fight off causes guaranteed inflammation of the nasal cavities and will lead to more severe sinus infection. The proper way to release toxic viral particles is the snot rocket.

The Mouth and Throat:
The zooids in your body know how to express viral particles using channels within your body as a form of natural detox in every day life. When these channels deliver mucus to your mouth, throat and sinus cativities you will feel the instinct to spit. This mucus contains unexploaded viral particles which can become reactivated if swalloed. Project this mucus outside or in a safe direction such as a toilet or trash can.
